    "KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) is a simple supervised classification algorithm we can use to assign a class to new data point. It can be used for regression as well, KNN does not make any assumptions on the data distribution, hence it is non-parametric. It keeps all the training data to make future predictions by computing the similarity between an input sample and each training instance."
